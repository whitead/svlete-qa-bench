    "answer": "Bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to CD38, a protein expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells (Green2018, Cho2022 pages 14-15). These antibodies have two binding sites, one for CD38 and the other for CD3 on T cells, leading to T cell activation and subsequent killing of the myeloma cells (Cho2022 pages 14-15). In addition to blocking CD38, bispecific CD38 antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab also block immunosuppressive regulatory cells, including Treg, Breg, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to improved host-anti-tumor immunity (Cho2022 pages 1-2). Bispecific CD38 antibodies treat myeloma through pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), which has demonstrated remarkable efficacy targeting tumor antigens (Green2018 pages 1-1). In murine xenograft models of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the CD38-bispecific construct demonstrated excellent blood clearance and tumor targeting, resulting in 100% complete remissions by day 12 in MM and NHL xenograft models, ultimately curing 80% of mice at optimal doses (Green2018 pages 1-1). However, the text does not provide information on the specific mechanisms of action of bispecific CD38 antibodies in newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory patients (Verkleij2020 pages 1-1).",

    "question": "How can carbon nanotubes be manufactured at scale?",
    "model": "paperqa-1.0.0",
    "date": "2023-04-09",
    "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods, including electric arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition, and laser ablation pyrolysis (Saravanan2010). The electric-arc technique can generate large quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with similar characteristics to those obtained by laser ablation (Journet1997). In the electric arc-discharge apparatus, the arc is generated between two electrodes in a reactor under a helium atmosphere, and a mixture of a metallic catalyst and graphite powder is used (Journet1997). The growth mechanism for SWNTs must be independent of the details of the technique used to make them (Journet1997). The CoMoCAT method, a catalytic method, has been used to synthesize single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at a small-scale production rate of approximately 100 grams per day (Gavankar2015). The decrease in energy requirement for carbon nanotube synthesis is observed with increased level of manufacturing readiness for high-pressure carbon monoxide conversion, chemical vapor deposition, and arc discharge manufacturing (Gavankar2015). Other methods for large-scale production of carbon nanotubes include CO2-assisted growth, fluidized bed catalytic chemical vapor deposition, and the use of natural materials as catalysts (The2012). However, challenges in growing large quantities of pure, defect-free nanotubes have limited their widespread use (De6119). While there are several methods for mass production of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including casting methods such as slip casting, tape casting, and gel casting, the text does not directly answer the question of what the methods are for mass production of CNTs (Meshalkin2020).",

    "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods. One method is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which utilizes high energy to atomize gaseous carbon sources such as methane, carbon monoxide, and acetylene[1]. Another method is laser ablation, which uses a high-power laser to vaporize a graphite source loaded with a metal catalyst[2]. Researchers at Western Michigan University\n have also developed a method for forming carbon nanotubes in a \nhigh-density, closely packed configuration, enabling their large-scale \nproduction[3]. Recently, MIT\n researchers have demonstrated that carbon nanotube transistors can be \nmade swiftly in commercial facilities, with the same equipment used to \nmanufacture silicon-based transistors[4].",
