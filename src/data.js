        "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods. One method is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which utilizes high energy to atomize gaseous carbon sources such as methane, carbon monoxide, and acetylene[1]. Another method is laser ablation, which uses a high-power laser to vaporize a graphite source loaded with a metal catalyst[2]. Researchers at Western Michigan University have also developed a method for forming carbon nanotubes in a high-density, closely packed configuration, enabling their large-scale production[3]",
