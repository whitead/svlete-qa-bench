        "answer": "There is limited information on bispecific CD38 antibodies in the provided sources. Verkleij2020 pages 4-4 and Dalla2020 pages 1-2 do not provide information on bispecific CD38 antibodies. However, Verkleij2020 pages 1-1 and Verkleij2020 pages 6-6 discuss the use of CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These antibodies work by binding to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells and inducing immune-mediated cell death. \n\nWhile there is no mention of bispecific CD38 antibodies specifically, Verkleij2020 pages 6-6 discusses various bispecific antibodies that target different proteins for the treatment of multiple myeloma. For example, AMG 424 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD38 and CD3, and Bi 38-3 is a bispecific antibody that targets CD38 and CD3. These antibodies work by redirecting T-cells to attack cancer cells. \n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to CD38 and another protein, such as CD3, and work by redirecting T-cells to attack myeloma cells. However, more information is needed to fully understand the mechanism of action of bispecific CD38 antibodies.",

        "question": "How can carbon nanotubes be manufactured at scale?",
        "model": "paperqa-1.0.0",
        "date": "2023-04-08",
        "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods and techniques, including chemical vapor deposition, arc discharge, laser ablation, and roll-to-roll continuous manufacturing (Zhang2020 pages 8-8). One specific roll-to-roll continuous manufacturing process involves depositing a conductive polymer coating layer of PEDOT:PSS onto the carbon nanotube sheets, resulting in highly conductive carbon nanotube sheets that can be used in various engineering applications such as cabling, EMI shielding, flexible electronics, or electrodes for energy storage devices (Zhang2020 pages 7-8). Another method for large-scale production of carbon nanotubes involves using millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates in a chemical vapor deposition process, which is more productive than the conventional process on flat wafers due to the higher available growth surface and good fluidity of the spherical substrates (Xiang2007 pages 1-2). The scalability of carbon nanotube sheets produced through roll-to-roll manufacturing makes it a promising raw material for a wide range of engineering applications (Zhang2020 pages 2-2). Additionally, certain post-treatment methods can be used to further increase conductivity, such as nitric acid treatment and mechanical densification (Zhang2020 pages 1-1). However, the article does not provide information on all methods or techniques for manufacturing carbon nanotubes at scale, and further research may be necessary to fully understand the range of options available (Zhang2020 pages 8-8, Xiang2007 pages 7-8).",

        "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods. One method is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which utilizes high energy to atomize gaseous carbon sources such as methane, carbon monoxide, and acetylene[1]. Another method is laser ablation, which uses a high-power laser to vaporize a graphite source loaded with a metal catalyst[2]. Researchers at Western Michigan University\n have also developed a method for forming carbon nanotubes in a \nhigh-density, closely packed configuration, enabling their large-scale \nproduction[3]. Recently, MIT\n researchers have demonstrated that carbon nanotube transistors can be \nmade swiftly in commercial facilities, with the same equipment used to \nmanufacture silicon-based transistors[4].",

        "answer": "Bispecific CD38\n antibodies are designed to bind to both CD38, a protein found on the \nsurface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and CD3, a protein found on T \ncells[1][2]. By binding to both CD38 and CD3, bispecific CD38 antibodies activate T cells to attack and kill MM cells[1][3]. This mechanism of action is similar to that of other anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab and isatuximab[4].\n Bispecific CD38 antibodies are a novel immunotherapeutic modality that \nhas shown impressive preliminary efficacy in heavily treated MM patients[1]. They are expected to become an integral part of the MM treatment paradigm in the near future[1].",
