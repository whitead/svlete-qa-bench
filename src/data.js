    "answer": "Bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to CD38, a protein expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells (Green2018, Cho2022 pages 14-15). These antibodies have two binding sites, one for CD38 and the other for CD3 on T cells, leading to T cell activation and subsequent killing of the myeloma cells (Cho2022 pages 14-15). In addition to blocking CD38, bispecific CD38 antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab also block immunosuppressive regulatory cells, including Treg, Breg, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to improved host-anti-tumor immunity (Cho2022 pages 1-2). Bispecific CD38 antibodies treat myeloma through pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), which has demonstrated remarkable efficacy targeting tumor antigens (Green2018 pages 1-1). In murine xenograft models of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the CD38-bispecific construct demonstrated excellent blood clearance and tumor targeting, resulting in 100% complete remissions by day 12 in MM and NHL xenograft models, ultimately curing 80% of mice at optimal doses (Green2018 pages 1-1). However, the text does not provide information on the specific mechanisms of action of bispecific CD38 antibodies in newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory patients (Verkleij2020 pages 1-1).",

    "question": "How can carbon nanotubes be manufactured at scale?",
    "model": "paperqa-1.0.0",
    "date": "2023-04-09",
    "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods, including electric arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition, and laser ablation pyrolysis (Saravanan2010). The electric-arc technique can generate large quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with similar characteristics to those obtained by laser ablation (Journet1997). In the electric arc-discharge apparatus, the arc is generated between two electrodes in a reactor under a helium atmosphere, and a mixture of a metallic catalyst and graphite powder is used (Journet1997). The growth mechanism for SWNTs must be independent of the details of the technique used to make them (Journet1997). The CoMoCAT method, a catalytic method, has been used to synthesize single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at a small-scale production rate of approximately 100 grams per day (Gavankar2015). The decrease in energy requirement for carbon nanotube synthesis is observed with increased level of manufacturing readiness for high-pressure carbon monoxide conversion, chemical vapor deposition, and arc discharge manufacturing (Gavankar2015). Other methods for large-scale production of carbon nanotubes include CO2-assisted growth, fluidized bed catalytic chemical vapor deposition, and the use of natural materials as catalysts (The2012). However, challenges in growing large quantities of pure, defect-free nanotubes have limited their widespread use (De6119). While there are several methods for mass production of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including casting methods such as slip casting, tape casting, and gel casting, the text does not directly answer the question of what the methods are for mass production of CNTs (Meshalkin2020).",

    "question": "What therapeutics are available or being researched for ALS as of 2022?",
    "model": "https://scite.ai/assistant",
    "date": "2023-04-09",
    "answer": "As of 2022, there are limited treatment options available for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients [1]. The only two modestly efficacious disease-modifying drugs available are riluzole and edaravone [1][6]. However, there are several therapeutics being researched for ALS treatment. Cell-based therapy has been proposed as an ultimate source for regeneration of motor neurons (MNs) [2][4]. Recent completion of non-autologous fetal spinal stem cell transplant to ALS patients brought renewed hope for further human trials to cure the disease [2]. Autologous somatic stem cell-based human trials are now in track to reveal the outcome of the ongoing trials [2]. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based ALS disease drug screen and autologous cell transplant options will broaden therapeutic options [2]. Astrocyte-based cell therapy is another potential treatment for ALS [3]. Embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes behave as highly trophic \u201cyoung astrocytes\u201d, being able to delay disease onset and prolong survival when injected intrathecally in murine models of ALS overexpressing the SOD1G93A mutation [3]. The safety and therapeutic potential of these cells are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial in ALS patients [3]. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) cells may be a promising new treatment for ALS, mainly by providing a protective microenvironment for motor neuron survival [5]. Among multiple advantages, hUCB cells' production of various anti-inflammatory/growth/trophic factors makes them an attractive cell source for ALS therapy [5]. Biodistribution and optimal hUCB cell dose for transplantation have been determined in current ALS clinical trials [5]. In addition to cell-based therapy, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has promise as a biomarker for ALS because it permits visualization of central nervous system (CNS) pathology in individuals living with ALS [1]. PET radioligands that target a variety of potential pathophysiological mechanisms\u2014including cerebral metabolism, neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and oxidative stress\u2014has enabled dynamic interrogation of molecular changes in ALS, in both natural history studies and human clinical trials [1]. In conclusion, while there are limited treatment options available for ALS patients, there are several promising therapeutics being researched, including cell-based therapy, astrocyte-based cell therapy, and human umbilical cord blood cells. PET imaging also has potential as a diagnostic biomarker for ALS.",

One common method is cluster analysis, which involves grouping similar conformations together[1]. Clustering algorithms have been widely used to reduce the dimensionality of molecular dynamics trajectories[2]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is another method that can be used to cluster protein structures[3]. The goal of clustering is to partition data so that data points inside a cluster are more similar to each other than they are to points outside a cluster[1]. Structural features from the substrate-binding cavity of the receptor can also be used to optimize docking experiments on a cloud[2].",

One such method is fuzzy clustering, which can locate classes of similar three-dimensional conformations explored during a molecular dynamics simulation [1]. Another method is quantum clustering, which can objectively cluster the conformations sampled by molecular dynamics simulations performed on different ligand-bound structures of the protein [2]. K-means clustering is another widely used clustering algorithm that can be implemented in the protein essential dynamics subspace defined by principal component analysis on the molecular dynamics trajectory [4]. In addition to clustering, visualizing the solvent paths entering and leaving cavities of the protein can also be useful in studying the route and dynamics of the exchange of tightly bound internal water molecules with the bulk solvent [3]. Overall, the choice of clustering method depends on the specific research question and the type of data being analyzed. It is important to choose a method that is appropriate for the data and can provide meaningful insights into the protein structures.",

    "answer": "When selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, there are several factors to consider. The diene component must be able to assume an s-cis conformation, and electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile facilitate the reaction. Electron-donating groups on the diene also facilitate the reaction[1]. Controlling the reaction to select for the endo product relies on changing the HOMO and/or LUMO of the system[2]. The reactivity and stereoselectivity in the Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction are controlled by a combination of several interaction terms[3]. Physical factors leading to the computed periodic reactivity trend upon going from the uncatalyzed to the bond-catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions can be analyzed and compared[4]. Additionally, external electric fields can be used as a catalyst to manipulate the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction[5].",

    "model": "https://scite.ai/assistant",
    "date": "2023-04-10",
    "answer": "When selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, several factors should be considered. The nature of the catalyst can affect the reaction rate, selectivity, and yield of the product. The following are some factors to consider when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction: 1. Lewis acidity: Catalysts with high Lewis acidity can activate the dienophile and diene, leading to faster reaction rates and higher yields. For example, silica and alumina modified by Lewis acids have been shown to be efficient catalysts in Diels-Alder reactions of carbonyl-containing dienophiles [2]. 2. Chirality: Chiral catalysts can induce enantioselectivity in the reaction, leading to the formation of a single enantiomer of the product. For example, oxazaborolidinone-catalyzed enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions have been reported [1]. 3. Stability: Catalysts that are stable under the reaction conditions can be reused, reducing the cost of the reaction. For example, the catalyst SiO2\u00b7AlClEt2 retains a great deal of its catalytic activity when recovered or stored in the open air for one month [2]. 4. Endo/exo selectivity: Catalysts can influence the endo/exo selectivity of the reaction, leading to the formation of either endo or exo adducts. For example, allo-threonine-derived O-acyl-B-phenyl-oxazaborolidinones are highly enantioselective Lewis acid catalysts for the Diels-Alder reaction of simple acyclic enone dienophiles, expanding the scope of ketone dienophiles and dienes [1]. 5. Reactivity: Catalysts can affect the reactivity of the dienophile and diene, leading to the formation of the desired product. For example, carbocations such as Ph3C+ have been shown to be extremely efficient, mild, and selective Lewis acid catalysts for Diels-Alder reactions [3]. In summary, when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, factors such as Lewis acidity, chirality, stability, endo/exo selectivity, and reactivity should be considered. The choice of catalyst can significantly affect the reaction rate, selectivity, and yield of the product [1]. [2][3]",

    "model": "https://scite.ai/assistant",
    "date": "2023-04-10",
    "answer": "Deep learning has brought a dramatic development in molecular property prediction that is crucial in the field of drug discovery using various representations such as fingerprints, SMILES, and graphs [1]. SMILES is commonly used in chemistry applications with SMILES sequences [2]. However, SMILES has a limitation in that it is hard to reflect chemical properties [1]. SELFIEs, on the other hand, have been shown to be superior to SMILES for tasks such as Optical Chemical Entity Recognition [4][5]. SELFIEs match the representation used in MACCS, which is commonly used in regression models [2]. However, using SELFIEs over SMILES does not necessarily translate to better supervised learning performance [2]. In addition, there exists a performance gap between the existing unpretrained SMILES-based models and graph-based models at large-scale benchmark results, while pretrain models are resource-demanding at training [3]. Therefore, it can be concluded that SELFIEs are a better representation of molecules for deep learning than SMILES, but the choice of representation depends on the specific task and the availability of resources.",

    "answer": "Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder with many drug targets contributing to its etiology [3]. While increased production and deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are believed to be key pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease, other potential therapeutic targets have been identified [1][2][4]. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) have been identified as being involved in the pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and causes Alzheimer's disease [3]. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is also considered a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [4]. Additionally, peripheral blood biomarkers offer a promising, non-intrusive mechanism for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis [5]. The corpus callosum has also been identified as a novel target for human neural stem cell transplantation in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse models [6]. Therefore, potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, other than Abeta, include GSK-3\u03b2, CDK5, p38 MAPK, peripheral blood biomarkers, and the corpus callosum.",

Some salamanders breathe through their gills, while others breathe through their lungs. Salamanders primarily rely on their skin for respiration, which is thin and permeable, allowing oxygen to diffuse into their bloodstream and carbon dioxide to diffuse out. Salamanders that live on land lose their gills as they grow older. Salamander larvae breathe through their gills, while adult salamanders such as the lungless salamanders breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth, which is called buccopharyngeal respiration.

XAI methods like chemical counterfactuals and descriptor explanations can explain deep learning predictions while giving insight into structure-property relationships [1][2]. XAI methods can also be used to predict molecular properties and optimize molecular properties and synthetic pathways [3][4].

Microorganisms and biomass can also be used for the synthesis of the constituent monomers of PET from renewable sources [2]. The use of microalgal biomass as a feedstock for PHA synthesis presents a low-cost solution [3]. Activated sludge processes can be used for treating wastewater and producing PHAs [4]. The energy required for microbial synthesis of plastics can be generated from renewable resources [1]. Therefore, the materials required input to use microorganisms for synthesis of plastics include renewable carbohydrate sources, microorganisms, biomass, and energy from renewable resources.",

    "answer": "Birds flock for various reasons, including foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, and social behavior [1]. Mixed-species flocks of birds involve species with different roles and foraging strategies and are ubiquitous in forest environments [1]. The diversity of foraging strategies occurring in a mixed flock reflects the diversity of participant species [1]. One of the main benefits of participating in mixed-species flocks is increased foraging efficiency [1]. However, feeding benefits remain under debate, probably because not all participants receive this benefit in the same way [1]. Species roles can broadly be categorized into leaders that attract others to form the flock, as well as lead the flock's movement; and follower species [1]. The predator avoidance hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their vigilance levels and decrease their predation risk [2]. The foraging efficiency hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their foraging efficiency and/or can spend more time feeding and less time looking out for predators [3]. The social behavior hypothesis suggests that birds flock for social reasons, such as to find mates or to learn from other birds [4]. In conclusion, birds flock for various reasons, including foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, and social behavior, and mixed-species flocks involve species with different roles and foraging strategies [1].",

    "question": "How can carbon nanotubes be manufactured at scale?",
    "model": "https://scite.ai/assistant",
    "date": "2023-04-10",
    "answer": "Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods. One method is the thermal decomposition of a ferrocenyl compound in the presence of a multi(ethynyl)aromatic compound [1]. Another method is the use of an arc-jet plasma of high temperature to decompose methane [2]. Ethanol thermal reduction process can also be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes on a large scale [3]. The flame method is another simple method that can be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes [4]. Large-scale production of carbon nanotubes can also be achieved by using millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates [5]. The method described in [1] permits the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes in a shaped, solid configuration. The carbon nanotubes form under atmospheric pressure during the carbonization process above 500 \u00b0C in the carbonaceous solid. The Fe atoms, nanoclusters, and/or nanoparticles formed from the decomposition of the ferrocenyl compound are the key to the formation of the carbon nanotubes in the developing carbonaceous solid by reacting with the developing polycondensed aromatic ring system. The arc-jet plasma process described in [2] is continuous and easily scalable, making it a promising technique for the large-scale commercial production of carbon nanotubes. The optimal operating condition for the production of high purity multi-walled carbon nanotubes was found in this study. The ethanol thermal reduction process described in [3] uses ethanol as the carbon source and magnesium as the reductant. This method avoids the use of toxic or corrosive reagents and can potentially be applied on the scale of industrial production. The flame method described in [4] is a new and simple method that may have the possibility of large-scale mass production for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. It needs not the vacuum environment and carbon nanotubes can be captured at the normal atmospheric pressure. The use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates for the large scale and continuous production of aligned carbon nanotube arrays is reported in [5]. This technique is more productive than the conventional process on flat wafers because of the higher available growth surface and the good fluidity of the spherical substrates. In conclusion, there are various methods for the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes, including thermal decomposition, arc-jet plasma, ethanol thermal reduction, flame method, and the use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and requirements.",

    "answer": "CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in almost all myeloma cells, making it an attractive treatment target [1]. Bispecific antibodies targeting CD38 and CD3 have been developed as a therapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma [2]. These antibodies recruit effector T cells to CD38-expressing myeloma cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [2]. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies have been approved for first-line treatment in non-transplantable multiple myeloma patients [1]. Isatuximab-irfc and daratumumab are examples of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies that have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [4]. However, it has been found that anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies bind to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and cause pan agglutination in indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), resulting in false positives of IAT and thereby interfering with blood bank testing and leading to the delay of further diagnosis and treatment [1]. Bispecific CD38 antibodies have the potential to overcome the limitations of current therapies in patients with multiple myeloma by triggering the complete elimination of malignant multiple myeloma cells in patients, including low-expressing cells that may evade daratumumab, with the potential to induce profound clinical responses [3]. In conclusion, bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to CD38 on myeloma cells and recruit effector T cells to induce ADCC, making them an effective therapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma.",

    "question": "What do bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to and how do they treat myeloma?",
    "model": "paperqa-1.1.1",
    "date": "2023-04-11",
    "answer": "Bispecific CD38 antibodies are a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These antibodies work by redirecting T cells to attack CD38-expressing myeloma cells (Shih2022). CD38 is a promising target for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma due to its high expression on myeloma cells and its role in regulating the immune system (Shih2022). Specific examples of CD38-targeting bispecific antibodies mentioned in the literature include BI38-3, MEDI2228, and AMG 424 (Shih2022). However, neither Shih2022 nor Verkleij4076 provide a direct quote that specifically answers the question of what bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to and how they treat myeloma. \n\nThat being said, other sources suggest that CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, are used in combination therapy and can be effective in eliminating myeloma cells (Verkleij4076). These antibodies bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Palumbo2016). ADCC involves the binding of the antibody to the target cell, which then activates immune cells to attack and kill the target cell. CDC involves the activation of the complement system, which leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex that can lyse the target cell (Palumbo2016). \n\nIn summary, while the literature suggests that bispecific CD38 antibodies are a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the specific mechanism of action of these antibodies is not provided in the sources available. However, other CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, are known to bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells and induce ADCC and CDC, leading to the elimination of myeloma cells (Verkleij4076, Palumbo2016). \n\nSources: \n- Shih2022 pages 14-15\n- Verkleij4076 pages 1-1\n- Palumbo2016",

    "question": "What therapeutics are available or being researched for ALS as of 2022?",
    "model": "paperqa-1.1.1",
    "date": "2023-04-11",
    "answer": "As of 2022, several antisense therapeutics are being researched for ALS, including BIIB105, an antisense therapeutic designed to decrease ATXN2 expression, which has demonstrated increased survival in a mouse model of TDP-43 ALS and is currently undergoing phase I clinical evaluation (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Additionally, an investigational FUS-targeted AO (ION363) has been administered to one patient, and a phase I-III clinical trial for this drug has recently been announced (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). However, the C9orf72 targeting AO BIIB078 was recently evaluated in phase I clinical trial and designed to selectively target C9orf72 transcripts with repeat expansions, but the trial was terminated in March 2022 due to not meeting primary or secondary endpoints (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Alternative AO strategies and sequences targeting C9orf72 are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, including WVE-004 and a\ufb01nersen (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Tofersen (BIIB067) is an antisense therapy designed to target and reduce SOD1 mRNA, currently under evaluation in phase III studies for patients carrying pathogenic SOD1 mutations (Roberts2022 pages 11-12).\n\nIn addition to antisense therapeutics, other therapeutic options for ALS have historically focused on slowing disease progression and providing symptomatic treatments to improve patient quality of life, including pain management, therapeutic exercise, and physiotherapy (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). Riluzole and edaravone are the only two drugs approved by the FDA for ALS treatment, with riluzole being the most widely used (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). However, their efficacy remains controversial, and more than 70 randomized drug trials in ALS patients have shown little beneficial effect on patient survival (Roberts2022 pages 9-10).\n\nWhile the article by Agrawal2022 does not provide information on available or being researched therapeutics for ALS in 2022, the article by Belgin2022 discusses past and future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALS, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, as well as emerging therapies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy (Belgin2022 pages 1-1). The authors emphasize the multifaceted nature of ALS affected by many pathological mechanisms and the need for further research to develop effective treatments for ALS (Belgin2022 pages 1-1).\n\nThe article by Tereza2020 discusses various therapeutic approaches for ALS, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and neurotrophic factors (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). One gene therapy, VM202, has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing ALSFRS-R decline (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Another compound, SynCav1, has shown promise in improving motor function and survival in preclinical ALS mouse models (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Cell-based therapies, such as astrocyte-based therapies and the transplantation of human glial restricted progenitor cells, have also shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Kadimastem Ltd. has reported promising interim results in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial using AstroRx\u00ae cells, which contain functional healthy astrocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). A Phase 1/2a open-label study will also be initiated in 2020 to investigate the safety of the transplantation of human glial restricted progenitor cells into the spinal cord of ALS patients (Tereza2020 pages 25-26).",

    "date": "2023-04-11",
    "answer": "Several potential targets for Alzheimer's disease beyond ABeta have been identified in the literature. Hampel5481 pages 22-23 discusses genetic loci such as TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7, as well as common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33, and CD2AP. Loss-of-function variants in ABCA7 are also mentioned as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the article discusses the importance of identifying preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease and the potential use of amyloid positron emission tomography for staging beta-amyloid pathology. Chandra5424 pages 17-17 suggests that tau protein and neuroinflammation may be alternative targets for Alzheimer's disease, in addition to amyloid-beta, and cites several studies investigating the use of PET imaging to detect tau protein and neuroinflammation in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Chen2022 pages 4-5 mentions signaling pathways that induce cerebral blood flow, excessive synthesis of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and decreased expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) as potential targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment. The text suggests that targeting these pathways may help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and prevent amyloid accumulation in the brain. However, Jens2013 pages 9-9 does not provide specific information on other potential targets.",

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on random forest models, sequence models, and graph neural networks in both classification and regression tasks (Geemi3697 pages 1-1).

    "question": "Why do birds flock?",
    "model": "paperqa-1.1.1",
    "date": "2023-04-11",
    "answer": "Birds flock for a variety of reasons, including social, navigational, and anti-predator implications (Usherwood2011). Flying in a flock can result in aerodynamic benefits, reducing power requirements, as demonstrated by a reduction in heart rate and wingbeat frequency in pelicans flying in a V-formation (Usherwood2011). However, the aerodynamic consequences of flying in the more usual \u2018cluster\u2019 flock are not well understood (Usherwood2011). The main goal of the interaction among birds in a flock is to maintain cohesion of the aggregation, which is a strong biological requirement shaped by the evolutionary pressure for survival (Ballerini1232). Stragglers and small groups are significantly more prone to predation than animals belonging to large and highly cohesive aggregations (Ballerini1232). The vast majority of models, both developed by physicists and biologists, adopt a definition of \u2018distance\u2019 that is the same as in physics, i.e. metric distance, and animals can estimate metric distance in various ways, including stereovision, retinal image size, and optic flow (Ballerini1232). The variability of shape in bird flocks increases when there are larger local differences in movement behavior in the flock, which happens when flock size is larger, interacting partners are fewer, the flock turnings are stronger, and individuals roll into the turn (Hemelrijk2011). A major benefit of bird flocking behavior is that it increases collective vigilance and allows for early detection of attacking predators, which relies on rapid transfer of information about danger from the individual first detecting the predator (Mae4173). Acoustic signals or cues of danger are likely to be particularly effective, as information is passed rapidly to all nearby members of a group, and can be detected even if a bird is not currently vigilant or is out of sight (Mae4173). Flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many directions, which provides for faster information transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics, an advantage over local models (Pearce1042). It optimizes the information available to each bird while maintaining the protection of a dense, coherent flock (Pearce1042).",
