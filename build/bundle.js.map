These antibodies have two binding sites, one for CD38 and the other for CD3 on T cells, leading to T cell activation and subsequent killing of the myeloma cells (Cho2022 pages 14-15). In addition to blocking CD38, bispecific CD38 antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab also block immunosuppressive regulatory cells, including Treg, Breg, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to improved host-anti-tumor immunity (Cho2022 pages 1-2). Bispecific CD38 antibodies treat myeloma through pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), which has demonstrated remarkable efficacy targeting tumor antigens (Green2018 pages 1-1). In murine xenograft models of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the CD38-bispecific construct demonstrated excellent blood clearance and tumor targeting, resulting in 100% complete remissions by day 12 in MM and NHL xenograft models, ultimately curing 80% of mice at optimal doses (Green2018 pages 1-1).

The electric-arc technique can generate large quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with similar characteristics to those obtained by laser ablation (Journet1997). In the electric arc-discharge apparatus, the arc is generated between two electrodes in a reactor under a helium atmosphere, and a mixture of a metallic catalyst and graphite powder is used (Journet1997). The growth mechanism for SWNTs must be independent of the details of the technique used to make them (Journet1997). The CoMoCAT method, a catalytic method, has been used to synthesize single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at a small-scale production rate of approximately 100 grams per day (Gavankar2015). The decrease in energy requirement for carbon nanotube synthesis is observed with increased level of manufacturing readiness for high-pressure carbon monoxide conversion, chemical vapor deposition, and arc discharge manufacturing (Gavankar2015). Other methods for large-scale production of carbon nanotubes include CO2-assisted growth, fluidized bed catalytic chemical vapor deposition, and the use of natural materials as catalysts (The2012). However, challenges in growing large quantities of pure, defect-free nanotubes have limited their widespread use (De6119). While there are several methods for mass production of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including casting methods such as slip casting, tape casting, and gel casting, the text does not directly answer the question of what the methods are for mass production of CNTs (Meshalkin2020).\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"Journet1997 pages 1-1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Journet, C., Maser, W.

These antibodies work by redirecting T cells to attack CD38-expressing myeloma cells (Shih2022). CD38 is a promising target for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma due to its high expression on myeloma cells and its role in regulating the immune system (Shih2022). Specific examples of CD38-targeting bispecific antibodies mentioned in the literature include BI38-3, MEDI2228, and AMG 424 (Shih2022).

These antibodies bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Palumbo2016). ADCC involves the binding of the antibody to the target cell, which then activates immune cells to attack and kill the target cell. CDC involves the activation of the complement system, which leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex that can lyse the target cell (Palumbo2016). \\n\\nIn summary, while the literature suggests that bispecific CD38 antibodies are a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the specific mechanism of action of these antibodies is not provided in the sources available. However, other CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, are known to bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells and induce ADCC and CDC, leading to the elimination of myeloma cells (Verkleij4076, Palumbo2016). \\n\\nSources: \\n- Shih2022 pages 14-15\\n- Verkleij4076 pages 1-1\\n- Palumbo2016\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"Shih2022 pages 14-15\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Shih-Feng Cho, Tsung-Jang Yeh, K.

Additionally, an investigational FUS-targeted AO (ION363) has been administered to one patient, and a phase I-III clinical trial for this drug has recently been announced (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). However, the C9orf72 targeting AO BIIB078 was recently evaluated in phase I clinical trial and designed to selectively target C9orf72 transcripts with repeat expansions, but the trial was terminated in March 2022 due to not meeting primary or secondary endpoints (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Alternative AO strategies and sequences targeting C9orf72 are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, including WVE-004 and a\\ufb01nersen (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Tofersen (BIIB067) is an antisense therapy designed to target and reduce SOD1 mRNA, currently under evaluation in phase III studies for patients carrying pathogenic SOD1 mutations (Roberts2022 pages 11-12).\\n\\nIn addition to antisense therapeutics, other therapeutic options for ALS have historically focused on slowing disease progression and providing symptomatic treatments to improve patient quality of life, including pain management, therapeutic exercise, and physiotherapy (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). Riluzole and edaravone are the only two drugs approved by the FDA for ALS treatment, with riluzole being the most widely used (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). However, their efficacy remains controversial, and more than 70 randomized drug trials in ALS patients have shown little beneficial effect on patient survival (Roberts2022 pages 9-10).\\n\\nWhile the article by Agrawal2022 does not provide information on available or being researched therapeutics for ALS in 2022, the article by Belgin2022 discusses past and future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALS, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, as well as emerging therapies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy (Belgin2022 pages 1-1). The authors emphasize the multifaceted nature of ALS affected by many pathological mechanisms and the need for further research to develop effective treatments for ALS (Belgin2022 pages 1-1).\\n\\nThe article by Tereza2020 discusses various therapeutic approaches for ALS, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and neurotrophic factors (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). One gene therapy, VM202, has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing ALSFRS-R decline (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Another compound, SynCav1, has shown promise in improving motor function and survival in preclinical ALS mouse models (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Cell-based therapies, such as astrocyte-based therapies and the transplantation of human glial restricted progenitor cells, have also shown promise in preclinical and clinical trials (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). Kadimastem Ltd. has reported promising interim results in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial using AstroRx\\u00ae cells, which contain functional healthy astrocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (Tereza2020 pages 25-26). A Phase 1/2a open-label study will also be initiated in 2020 to investigate the safety of the transplantation of human glial restricted progenitor cells into the spinal cord of ALS patients (Tereza2020 pages 25-26).\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"Roberts2022 pages 11-12\",\r\n        \"text\": \"B.

Flying in a flock can result in aerodynamic benefits, reducing power requirements, as demonstrated by a reduction in heart rate and wingbeat frequency in pelicans flying in a V-formation (Usherwood2011). However, the aerodynamic consequences of flying in the more usual \\u2018cluster\\u2019 flock are not well understood (Usherwood2011). The main goal of the interaction among birds in a flock is to maintain cohesion of the aggregation, which is a strong biological requirement shaped by the evolutionary pressure for survival (Ballerini1232). Stragglers and small groups are significantly more prone to predation than animals belonging to large and highly cohesive aggregations (Ballerini1232). The vast majority of models, both developed by physicists and biologists, adopt a definition of \\u2018distance\\u2019 that is the same as in physics, i.e. metric distance, and animals can estimate metric distance in various ways, including stereovision, retinal image size, and optic flow (Ballerini1232). The variability of shape in bird flocks increases when there are larger local differences in movement behavior in the flock, which happens when flock size is larger, interacting partners are fewer, the flock turnings are stronger, and individuals roll into the turn (Hemelrijk2011). A major benefit of bird flocking behavior is that it increases collective vigilance and allows for early detection of attacking predators, which relies on rapid transfer of information about danger from the individual first detecting the predator (Mae4173). Acoustic signals or cues of danger are likely to be particularly effective, as information is passed rapidly to all nearby members of a group, and can be detected even if a bird is not currently vigilant or is out of sight (Mae4173). Flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many directions, which provides for faster information transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics, an advantage over local models (Pearce1042). It optimizes the information available to each bird while maintaining the protection of a dense, coherent flock (Pearce1042).\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"Usherwood2011 pages 1-1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"J.

The monolayer SWNTs can be patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the high currents (~3mA) SWNT devices with narrow channel widths. The method is generic for different bulk materials with various diameters (Xiaoling4890 pages 1-1). Another method for producing graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is by unzipping the side walls of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using intercalation with suitable ions. The intertube intercalation of CNTs by different ions has been shown to be an effective method to decrease the van der Waals interactions between individual tubes and assist the exfoliation of bundled CNTs. By selecting appropriate neutral molecules or ions to substitute H2SO4 as an intercalation agent, it shall be a promising approach to produce GNRs with a high yield and further reduce the usage of strong acid during the nanotube unzipping (Yan2016 pages 1-2). Additionally, a green and scalable method for the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons is by intercalation-assisted longitudinal unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with KNO3 and H2SO4, which decreases the strong van der Waals attractions in the MWCNTs bundles and between the coaxial graphene walls of CNTs. The developed methodology possesses the ability to synthesize GNRs effectively with an improved CNT concentration in H2SO4 of 10 mg/ml at 70 \\u00b0C, which is amenable to industrial-scale production because of the decreased amount of strong acid (Yan2016 pages 1-1). The LB assembly of densely aligned SWNTs can be combined with chemical separation and selective chemical reaction methods to afford purely metallic or semiconducting SWNTs in massive parallel configuration useful for interconnection or high-speed transistor applications at large scale (Xiaoling4890 pages 2-2).\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"Xiaoling4890 pages 1-1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Xiaoling Li, Li Zhang, Xinran Wang, I.

The only two modestly efficacious disease-modifying drugs available are riluzole and edaravone [1][6]. However, there are several therapeutics being researched for ALS treatment. Cell-based therapy has been proposed as an ultimate source for regeneration of motor neurons (MNs) [2][4]. Recent completion of non-autologous fetal spinal stem cell transplant to ALS patients brought renewed hope for further human trials to cure the disease [2]. Autologous somatic stem cell-based human trials are now in track to reveal the outcome of the ongoing trials [2]. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based ALS disease drug screen and autologous cell transplant options will broaden therapeutic options [2]. Astrocyte-based cell therapy is another potential treatment for ALS [3]. Embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes behave as highly trophic \\u201cyoung astrocytes\\u201d, being able to delay disease onset and prolong survival when injected intrathecally in murine models of ALS overexpressing the SOD1G93A mutation [3]. The safety and therapeutic potential of these cells are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial in ALS patients [3]. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) cells may be a promising new treatment for ALS, mainly by providing a protective microenvironment for motor neuron survival [5]. Among multiple advantages, hUCB cells' production of various anti-inflammatory/growth/trophic factors makes them an attractive cell source for ALS therapy [5]. Biodistribution and optimal hUCB cell dose for transplantation have been determined in current ALS clinical trials [5]. In addition to cell-based therapy, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has promise as a biomarker for ALS because it permits visualization of central nervous system (CNS) pathology in individuals living with ALS [1]. PET radioligands that target a variety of potential pathophysiological mechanisms\\u2014including cerebral metabolism, neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and oxidative stress\\u2014has enabled dynamic interrogation of molecular changes in ALS, in both natural history studies and human clinical trials [1]. In conclusion, while there are limited treatment options available for ALS patients, there are several promising therapeutics being researched, including cell-based therapy, astrocyte-based cell therapy, and human umbilical cord blood cells. PET imaging also has potential as a diagnostic biomarker for ALS.\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2019.00135/full\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"2\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.en-journal.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.5607/en.2014.23.3.207\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"3\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-018-1006-y\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"4\",\r\n        \"text\": \"10.4172/2325-9620.1000118\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"5\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14712598.2017.1323862\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"6\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/med.21528\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"question\": \"What therapeutics are available or being researched for ALS as of 2022?\",\r\n    \"model\": \"perplexity\",\r\n    \"date\": \"2023-04-09\",\r\n    \"answer\": \"As of 2022, there are six FDA-approved drugs for treating ALS and its symptoms, including RELYVRIO, Radicava, Rilutek, Tiglutik, Exservan, and Nuedexta[1].

The nature of the catalyst can affect the reaction rate, selectivity, and yield of the product. The following are some factors to consider when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction: 1. Lewis acidity: Catalysts with high Lewis acidity can activate the dienophile and diene, leading to faster reaction rates and higher yields. For example, silica and alumina modified by Lewis acids have been shown to be efficient catalysts in Diels-Alder reactions of carbonyl-containing dienophiles [2]. 2. Chirality: Chiral catalysts can induce enantioselectivity in the reaction, leading to the formation of a single enantiomer of the product. For example, oxazaborolidinone-catalyzed enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions have been reported [1]. 3. Stability: Catalysts that are stable under the reaction conditions can be reused, reducing the cost of the reaction. For example, the catalyst SiO2\\u00b7AlClEt2 retains a great deal of its catalytic activity when recovered or stored in the open air for one month [2]. 4. Endo/exo selectivity: Catalysts can influence the endo/exo selectivity of the reaction, leading to the formation of either endo or exo adducts. For example, allo-threonine-derived O-acyl-B-phenyl-oxazaborolidinones are highly enantioselective Lewis acid catalysts for the Diels-Alder reaction of simple acyclic enone dienophiles, expanding the scope of ketone dienophiles and dienes [1]. 5. Reactivity: Catalysts can affect the reactivity of the dienophile and diene, leading to the formation of the desired product. For example, carbocations such as Ph3C+ have been shown to be extremely efficient, mild, and selective Lewis acid catalysts for Diels-Alder reactions [3]. In summary, when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, factors such as Lewis acidity, chirality, stability, endo/exo selectivity, and reactivity should be considered.

SELFIEs match the representation used in MACCS, which is commonly used in regression models [2].

Mixed-species flocks of birds involve species with different roles and foraging strategies and are ubiquitous in forest environments [1].

One of the main benefits of participating in mixed-species flocks is increased foraging efficiency [1]. However, feeding benefits remain under debate, probably because not all participants receive this benefit in the same way [1]. Species roles can broadly be categorized into leaders that attract others to form the flock, as well as lead the flock's movement; and follower species [1]. The predator avoidance hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their vigilance levels and decrease their predation risk [2]. The foraging efficiency hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their foraging efficiency and/or can spend more time feeding and less time looking out for predators [3]. The social behavior hypothesis suggests that birds flock for social reasons, such as to find mates or to learn from other birds [4].

One method is the thermal decomposition of a ferrocenyl compound in the presence of a multi(ethynyl)aromatic compound [1]. Another method is the use of an arc-jet plasma of high temperature to decompose methane [2]. Ethanol thermal reduction process can also be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes on a large scale [3]. The flame method is another simple method that can be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes [4]. Large-scale production of carbon nanotubes can also be achieved by using millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates [5]. The method described in [1] permits the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes in a shaped, solid configuration. The carbon nanotubes form under atmospheric pressure during the carbonization process above 500 \\u00b0C in the carbonaceous solid. The Fe atoms, nanoclusters, and/or nanoparticles formed from the decomposition of the ferrocenyl compound are the key to the formation of the carbon nanotubes in the developing carbonaceous solid by reacting with the developing polycondensed aromatic ring system. The arc-jet plasma process described in [2] is continuous and easily scalable, making it a promising technique for the large-scale commercial production of carbon nanotubes. The optimal operating condition for the production of high purity multi-walled carbon nanotubes was found in this study. The ethanol thermal reduction process described in [3] uses ethanol as the carbon source and magnesium as the reductant. This method avoids the use of toxic or corrosive reagents and can potentially be applied on the scale of industrial production. The flame method described in [4] is a new and simple method that may have the possibility of large-scale mass production for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. It needs not the vacuum environment and carbon nanotubes can be captured at the normal atmospheric pressure. The use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates for the large scale and continuous production of aligned carbon nanotube arrays is reported in [5]. This technique is more productive than the conventional process on flat wafers because of the higher available growth surface and the good fluidity of the spherical substrates. In conclusion, there are various methods for the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes, including thermal decomposition, arc-jet plasma, ethanol thermal reduction, flame method, and the use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and requirements.\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp0665527\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"2\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567173905001926?via%3Dihub\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"3\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja035763b\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"4\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.scientific.net/AMR.1048.383\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"5\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cvde.200704249\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"question\": \"What do bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to and how do they treat myeloma?\",\r\n    \"model\": \"scite\",\r\n    \"date\": \"2023-04-10\",\r\n    \"answer\": \"CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in almost all myeloma cells, making it an attractive treatment target [1].

Another potential target is somatostatin, which regulates ABeta42 through modulation of proteolytic degradation. Downregulation of somatostatin expression may trigger ABeta accumulation leading to late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and somatostatin receptors may be pharmacological-target candidates for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease [2].

Modulation of X11beta function is another potential therapeutic target for ABeta-mediated neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease [6]. Other strategies that have been investigated to target ABeta include secretase modulators and anti-polymerization agents [7].

An alternative approach is to explain black-box models through explaining individual prediction using a locally interpretable model [6]. Finally, some researchers suggest a two-step process of highly accurate black-box modeling and then creating explanations to give both highly accurate predictions and clear structure-property relationships [7].\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.3390/ai4020023\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"2\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.1002/sam.11500\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"3\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38192-3\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"4\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-4qkg8-v2\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"5\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qt49t\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"6\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1909.12367\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"7\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-qfv02\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"question\": \"What materials and energy are required input to use microorganisms for synthesis of plastics?\",\r\n    \"model\": \"perplexity\",\r\n    \"date\": \"2023-06-05\",\r\n    \"answer\": \"Microorganisms can be used for the synthesis of biodegradable plastics.

By flying in a V-formation, birds can take advantage of this uplift and reduce their energy expenditure[3].\\n3. **Migration**: Avian flocks are typically associated with migration. By co-existing with one another in a flock, less time and energy is spent searching for predators. This mutual protection of one another within the flock is one of the benefits of living within a group[4].\\n4. **Warmth**: Some birds, such as starlings, form murmurations, which are flocks that constantly change direction and shape.

The reaction is characterized by its high regio- and stereoselectivity and is widely used in organic synthesis. When selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, several factors should be considered. \\n\\nOne important factor is the electronic nature of the catalyst. The dienophile's LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level is an important factor in determining the reaction rate, and the catalyst should be able to lower the energy of the dienophile's LUMO. Lewis acids are commonly used as catalysts for Diels-Alder reactions because they can complex with the dienophile and lower its LUMO energy level[1]. \\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the steric effects of the catalyst. The catalyst should be able to stabilize the transition state of the reaction and reduce the activation energy. Chiral catalysts can be used to control the stereochemistry of the reaction and improve the selectivity[2]. \\n\\nThe solvent used in the reaction can also affect the reaction rate and selectivity. For example, water has been shown to be an effective solvent for Diels-Alder reactions catalyzed by Lewis acids[3]. \\n\\nFinally, the structure of the diene and dienophile should be considered when selecting a catalyst. For example, electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile can accelerate the reaction rate, while electron-donating groups on the diene can improve the selectivity[4]. \\n\\nIn summary, when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, it is important to consider the electronic nature and steric effects of the catalyst, the solvent used in the reaction, and the structure of the diene and dienophile.\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.201914582\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"2\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/12/2/150\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"3\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja960318k\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"4\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2017/08/30/the-diels-alder-reaction/\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"question\": \"Are SELFIEs or SMILES a better representation of molecules for deep learning?\",\r\n    \"model\": \"perplexity\",\r\n    \"date\": \"2023-06-09\",\r\n    \"answer\": \"After reviewing the search results, it seems that the question is comparing two different things that are not directly related.

SMILES is a compact data format that can be easily stored and read in delimited text files[6][7]. \\n\\nIn terms of deep learning for molecular property prediction, recent advances for molecular representation learning have shown great promise in applying graph neural networks to model molecules[1][8]. Graph neural networks (GNN) have been considered as an attractive modeling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods[8]. \\n\\nIn conclusion, neither selfies nor smiles are relevant to molecular representation learning for deep learning.

Here are some of the methods that can be used:\\n\\nSHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\\nThe SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methodology is a model-agnostic approach that can be used to interpret any machine learning (ML) model, regardless of its complexity. SHAP enables the identification and prioritization of features that determine compound classification and activity prediction using any ML model[1]. \\n\\nSurrogate Models\\nOne approach to explain black-box predictions is to fit a self-explaining or interpretable model to the black-box model in the vicinity of one[2]. Surrogate models are interpretable models that are fitted to the black-box model to explain its predictions[3].\\n\\nFeature Attribution Methods\\nFeature attribution methods explain black-box predictions by assigning each input feature a numerical value, which indicates its importance or contribution to the prediction. Feature attributions provide local explanations but can be averaged or combined to explain multiple instances[2]. \\n\\nCounterfactual Explanations\\nCounterfactuals are human interpretable explanations composed of molecular structures that explain model predictions. Counterfactual generation has been a recent development in the field of machine learning and can be used to explain black-box model predictions[4].\\n\\nPost Hoc Analysis\\nPost hoc analysis consists of statistical analyses that were specified after the data were seen. They are usually used to uncover specific differences between three or more group means when an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is significant. Post hoc analysis can be used to explain the predictions of black-box models[5].\\n\\nThese methods can be used to explain the predictions of black box models in chemistry.

This process occurs when microorganisms use their enzymatic apparatus to break down polymers into smaller molecules and monomers, which can be used as carbon and energy sources and are ultimately mineralized by microorganisms, being converted into carbon dioxide, water, methane, and other compounds[1]. \\n\\nThe microbial degradation of most plastics is restricted to only a few taxa, remains slow, and in many cases is unproven or disputed. However, there are some plastics and/or their associated additives that provide organic carbon sources metabolizable by certain microorganisms[2]. \\n\\nTo use microorganisms for the synthesis of plastics, the microorganisms need to take in food, extract energy and nutrients from it, and excrete waste in order to survive. The metabolic potential of plastics as biotechnological carbon sources has been reviewed and targets for the future have been identified[3]. \\n\\nOverall, the materials and energy required to use microorganisms for the synthesis of plastics depend on the specific type of plastic and the microorganisms used. However, biological plastic degradation is often considered a more environmentally friendly method, receiving considerable attention from the scientific community, as it can reduce processing costs and circumvent the utilization and production of dangerous chemicals[1].\\n\",\r\n    \"sources\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"1\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9216477/\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"2\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://environmentalmicrobiome.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40793-020-00371-w\"\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"key\": \"3\",\r\n        \"text\": \"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717621001920\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"question\": \"Why do birds flock?\",\r\n    \"model\": \"perplexity\",\r\n    \"date\": \"2023-06-12\",\r\n    \"answer\": \"Birds flock together for several reasons, including protection from predators, foraging benefits, and communal warmth in cold temperatures[1][2][3]. Flocking also allows birds to fly further using less energy because when the strong leader bird flaps its wings, it creates uplift for the birds behind it[4]. Additionally, flocking behavior can help birds ward off predators and respond rapidly when a predator is in sight[3]. \\n\\nOne of the most famous examples of birds flocking and moving in unison is that of the European starling, whose huge flocks often number hundreds of thousands of birds[5][6]. Birds in flocks don't just follow a leader or their neighbors, but instead anticipate sudden changes in the flock's direction of motion, and once a change in direction begins in the flock, it then spreads through the flock in a wave[7]. \\n\\nIn conclusion, birds flock together for various reasons, including protection from predators, foraging benefits, communal warmth, and energy efficiency.

However, there are several studies that discuss the importance of neural population dynamics and how they provide a framework for understanding neural computation[1][2]. Neural circuits comprise networks of individual neurons that perform sensory, cognitive, and motor functions[1]. The brain contains millions of neurons that are organized into different brain areas, subregions, and layers, each with various cell types[3]. \\n\\nOne study identified two subsets of cholinergic neurons that are topographically segregated and possess unique electrophysiological signatures, express mutually exclusive marker genes, and make differential connections with physiologically distinct neuronal classes in the hippocampus to form two structurally defined and functionally distinct circuits[4]. Another study examined three genetically labeled, non-overlapping subpopulations of GABAergic neurons and their distribution patterns across columnar compartments in mouse barrel cortex[5]. \\n\\nIn terms of the effects of stimulating or inhibiting specific populations of neurons, one study found that electrical stimulation can inhibit synchronized neuronal activity[6]. Another study used optogenetic techniques to stimulate specific brain cells to increase production of neural stem cells and neurons relevant to memory and emotion processing in animal models[7]. However, it is important to note that prolonged optogenetic inhibition can lead to tissue heating, while chronic chemogenetic inhibition could result in desensitization and homeostatic adaptations[8].
