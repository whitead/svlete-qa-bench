These antibodies have two binding sites, one for CD38 and the other for CD3 on T cells, leading to T cell activation and subsequent killing of the myeloma cells (Cho2022 pages 14-15). In addition to blocking CD38, bispecific CD38 antibodies such as daratumumab and isatuximab also block immunosuppressive regulatory cells, including Treg, Breg, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to improved host-anti-tumor immunity (Cho2022 pages 1-2). Bispecific CD38 antibodies treat myeloma through pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT), which has demonstrated remarkable efficacy targeting tumor antigens (Green2018 pages 1-1). In murine xenograft models of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the CD38-bispecific construct demonstrated excellent blood clearance and tumor targeting, resulting in 100% complete remissions by day 12 in MM and NHL xenograft models, ultimately curing 80% of mice at optimal doses (Green2018 pages 1-1).

The electric-arc technique can generate large quantities of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with similar characteristics to those obtained by laser ablation (Journet1997). In the electric arc-discharge apparatus, the arc is generated between two electrodes in a reactor under a helium atmosphere, and a mixture of a metallic catalyst and graphite powder is used (Journet1997). The growth mechanism for SWNTs must be independent of the details of the technique used to make them (Journet1997). The CoMoCAT method, a catalytic method, has been used to synthesize single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) at a small-scale production rate of approximately 100 grams per day (Gavankar2015). The decrease in energy requirement for carbon nanotube synthesis is observed with increased level of manufacturing readiness for high-pressure carbon monoxide conversion, chemical vapor deposition, and arc discharge manufacturing (Gavankar2015). Other methods for large-scale production of carbon nanotubes include CO2-assisted growth, fluidized bed catalytic chemical vapor deposition, and the use of natural materials as catalysts (The2012). However, challenges in growing large quantities of pure, defect-free nanotubes have limited their widespread use (De6119). While there are several methods for mass production of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including casting methods such as slip casting, tape casting, and gel casting, the text does not directly answer the question of what the methods are for mass production of CNTs (Meshalkin2020).",sources:[{key:"Journet1997 pages 1-1",text:"Journet, C., Maser, W.

The only two modestly efficacious disease-modifying drugs available are riluzole and edaravone [1][6]. However, there are several therapeutics being researched for ALS treatment. Cell-based therapy has been proposed as an ultimate source for regeneration of motor neurons (MNs) [2][4]. Recent completion of non-autologous fetal spinal stem cell transplant to ALS patients brought renewed hope for further human trials to cure the disease [2]. Autologous somatic stem cell-based human trials are now in track to reveal the outcome of the ongoing trials [2]. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based ALS disease drug screen and autologous cell transplant options will broaden therapeutic options [2]. Astrocyte-based cell therapy is another potential treatment for ALS [3]. Embryonic stem cell-derived astrocytes behave as highly trophic “young astrocytes”, being able to delay disease onset and prolong survival when injected intrathecally in murine models of ALS overexpressing the SOD1G93A mutation [3]. The safety and therapeutic potential of these cells are currently being evaluated in a clinical trial in ALS patients [3]. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) cells may be a promising new treatment for ALS, mainly by providing a protective microenvironment for motor neuron survival [5]. Among multiple advantages, hUCB cells' production of various anti-inflammatory/growth/trophic factors makes them an attractive cell source for ALS therapy [5]. Biodistribution and optimal hUCB cell dose for transplantation have been determined in current ALS clinical trials [5]. In addition to cell-based therapy, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has promise as a biomarker for ALS because it permits visualization of central nervous system (CNS) pathology in individuals living with ALS [1]. PET radioligands that target a variety of potential pathophysiological mechanisms—including cerebral metabolism, neuroinflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and oxidative stress—has enabled dynamic interrogation of molecular changes in ALS, in both natural history studies and human clinical trials [1]. In conclusion, while there are limited treatment options available for ALS patients, there are several promising therapeutics being researched, including cell-based therapy, astrocyte-based cell therapy, and human umbilical cord blood cells.

K-means clustering is another widely used clustering algorithm that can be implemented in the protein essential dynamics subspace defined by principal component analysis on the molecular dynamics trajectory [4]. In addition to clustering, visualizing the solvent paths entering and leaving cavities of the protein can also be useful in studying the route and dynamics of the exchange of tightly bound internal water molecules with the bulk solvent [3].

The diene component must be able to assume an s-cis conformation, and electron-withdrawing groups on the dienophile facilitate the reaction. Electron-donating groups on the diene also facilitate the reaction[1]. Controlling the reaction to select for the endo product relies on changing the HOMO and/or LUMO of the system[2]. The reactivity and stereoselectivity in the Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction are controlled by a combination of several interaction terms[3]. Physical factors leading to the computed periodic reactivity trend upon going from the uncatalyzed to the bond-catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions can be analyzed and compared[4].

The nature of the catalyst can affect the reaction rate, selectivity, and yield of the product. The following are some factors to consider when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction: 1. Lewis acidity: Catalysts with high Lewis acidity can activate the dienophile and diene, leading to faster reaction rates and higher yields. For example, silica and alumina modified by Lewis acids have been shown to be efficient catalysts in Diels-Alder reactions of carbonyl-containing dienophiles [2]. 2. Chirality: Chiral catalysts can induce enantioselectivity in the reaction, leading to the formation of a single enantiomer of the product. For example, oxazaborolidinone-catalyzed enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions have been reported [1]. 3. Stability: Catalysts that are stable under the reaction conditions can be reused, reducing the cost of the reaction. For example, the catalyst SiO2·AlClEt2 retains a great deal of its catalytic activity when recovered or stored in the open air for one month [2]. 4. Endo/exo selectivity: Catalysts can influence the endo/exo selectivity of the reaction, leading to the formation of either endo or exo adducts. For example, allo-threonine-derived O-acyl-B-phenyl-oxazaborolidinones are highly enantioselective Lewis acid catalysts for the Diels-Alder reaction of simple acyclic enone dienophiles, expanding the scope of ketone dienophiles and dienes [1]. 5. Reactivity: Catalysts can affect the reactivity of the dienophile and diene, leading to the formation of the desired product. For example, carbocations such as Ph3C+ have been shown to be extremely efficient, mild, and selective Lewis acid catalysts for Diels-Alder reactions [3]. In summary, when selecting a catalyst for a Diels-Alder reaction, factors such as Lewis acidity, chirality, stability, endo/exo selectivity, and reactivity should be considered.

Mixed-species flocks of birds involve species with different roles and foraging strategies and are ubiquitous in forest environments [1]. The diversity of foraging strategies occurring in a mixed flock reflects the diversity of participant species [1]. One of the main benefits of participating in mixed-species flocks is increased foraging efficiency [1]. However, feeding benefits remain under debate, probably because not all participants receive this benefit in the same way [1]. Species roles can broadly be categorized into leaders that attract others to form the flock, as well as lead the flock's movement; and follower species [1]. The predator avoidance hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their vigilance levels and decrease their predation risk [2]. The foraging efficiency hypothesis suggests that birds in mixed flocks increase their foraging efficiency and/or can spend more time feeding and less time looking out for predators [3]. The social behavior hypothesis suggests that birds flock for social reasons, such as to find mates or to learn from other birds [4]. In conclusion, birds flock for various reasons, including foraging efficiency, predation avoidance, and social behavior, and mixed-species flocks involve species with different roles and foraging strategies [1].",sources:[{key:"1",text:"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.13162"},{key:"2",text:"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-004-0124-4"},{key:"3",text:"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12551"},{key:"4",text:"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00306525.1989.9639611"}]},{question:"How can carbon nanotubes be manufactured at scale?",model:"https://scite.ai/assistant",date:"2023-04-10",answer:"Carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at scale using various methods. One method is the thermal decomposition of a ferrocenyl compound in the presence of a multi(ethynyl)aromatic compound [1]. Another method is the use of an arc-jet plasma of high temperature to decompose methane [2]. Ethanol thermal reduction process can also be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes on a large scale [3]. The flame method is another simple method that can be used to synthesize carbon nanotubes [4]. Large-scale production of carbon nanotubes can also be achieved by using millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates [5]. The method described in [1] permits the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes in a shaped, solid configuration. The carbon nanotubes form under atmospheric pressure during the carbonization process above 500 °C in the carbonaceous solid. The Fe atoms, nanoclusters, and/or nanoparticles formed from the decomposition of the ferrocenyl compound are the key to the formation of the carbon nanotubes in the developing carbonaceous solid by reacting with the developing polycondensed aromatic ring system. The arc-jet plasma process described in [2] is continuous and easily scalable, making it a promising technique for the large-scale commercial production of carbon nanotubes. The optimal operating condition for the production of high purity multi-walled carbon nanotubes was found in this study. The ethanol thermal reduction process described in [3] uses ethanol as the carbon source and magnesium as the reductant. This method avoids the use of toxic or corrosive reagents and can potentially be applied on the scale of industrial production. The flame method described in [4] is a new and simple method that may have the possibility of large-scale mass production for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. It needs not the vacuum environment and carbon nanotubes can be captured at the normal atmospheric pressure. The use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates for the large scale and continuous production of aligned carbon nanotube arrays is reported in [5]. This technique is more productive than the conventional process on flat wafers because of the higher available growth surface and the good fluidity of the spherical substrates. In conclusion, there are various methods for the large-scale production of carbon nanotubes, including thermal decomposition, arc-jet plasma, ethanol thermal reduction, flame method, and the use of millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and requirements.",sources:[{key:"1",text:"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp0665527"},{key:"2",text:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567173905001926?via%3Dihub"},{key:"3",text:"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja035763b"},{key:"4",text:"https://www.scientific.net/AMR.1048.383"},{key:"5",text:"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cvde.200704249"}]},{question:"What do bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to and how do they treat myeloma?",model:"https://scite.ai/assistant",date:"2023-04-10",answer:"CD38 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed in almost all myeloma cells, making it an attractive treatment target [1]. Bispecific antibodies targeting CD38 and CD3 have been developed as a therapeutic strategy for multiple myeloma [2]. These antibodies recruit effector T cells to CD38-expressing myeloma cells and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [2]. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies have been approved for first-line treatment in non-transplantable multiple myeloma patients [1]. Isatuximab-irfc and daratumumab are examples of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies that have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [4]. However, it has been found that anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies bind to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and cause pan agglutination in indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), resulting in false positives of IAT and thereby interfering with blood bank testing and leading to the delay of further diagnosis and treatment [1]. Bispecific CD38 antibodies have the potential to overcome the limitations of current therapies in patients with multiple myeloma by triggering the complete elimination of malignant multiple myeloma cells in patients, including low-expressing cells that may evade daratumumab, with the potential to induce profound clinical responses [3].

These antibodies work by redirecting T cells to attack CD38-expressing myeloma cells (Shih2022). CD38 is a promising target for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma due to its high expression on myeloma cells and its role in regulating the immune system (Shih2022). Specific examples of CD38-targeting bispecific antibodies mentioned in the literature include BI38-3, MEDI2228, and AMG 424 (Shih2022). However, neither Shih2022 nor Verkleij4076 provide a direct quote that specifically answers the question of what bispecific CD38 antibodies bind to and how they treat myeloma. \n\nThat being said, other sources suggest that CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, are used in combination therapy and can be effective in eliminating myeloma cells (Verkleij4076). These antibodies bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Palumbo2016). ADCC involves the binding of the antibody to the target cell, which then activates immune cells to attack and kill the target cell. CDC involves the activation of the complement system, which leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex that can lyse the target cell (Palumbo2016). \n\nIn summary, while the literature suggests that bispecific CD38 antibodies are a promising immunotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the specific mechanism of action of these antibodies is not provided in the sources available. However, other CD38-targeting antibodies, such as daratumumab or isatuximab, are known to bind to CD38 on the surface of myeloma cells and induce ADCC and CDC, leading to the elimination of myeloma cells (Verkleij4076, Palumbo2016). \n\nSources: \n- Shih2022 pages 14-15\n- Verkleij4076 pages 1-1\n- Palumbo2016",sources:[{key:"Shih2022 pages 14-15",text:"Shih-Feng Cho, Tsung-Jang Yeh, K.

Additionally, an investigational FUS-targeted AO (ION363) has been administered to one patient, and a phase I-III clinical trial for this drug has recently been announced (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). However, the C9orf72 targeting AO BIIB078 was recently evaluated in phase I clinical trial and designed to selectively target C9orf72 transcripts with repeat expansions, but the trial was terminated in March 2022 due to not meeting primary or secondary endpoints (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Alternative AO strategies and sequences targeting C9orf72 are currently undergoing clinical evaluation, including WVE-004 and aﬁnersen (Roberts2022 pages 11-12). Tofersen (BIIB067) is an antisense therapy designed to target and reduce SOD1 mRNA, currently under evaluation in phase III studies for patients carrying pathogenic SOD1 mutations (Roberts2022 pages 11-12).\n\nIn addition to antisense therapeutics, other therapeutic options for ALS have historically focused on slowing disease progression and providing symptomatic treatments to improve patient quality of life, including pain management, therapeutic exercise, and physiotherapy (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). Riluzole and edaravone are the only two drugs approved by the FDA for ALS treatment, with riluzole being the most widely used (Roberts2022 pages 9-10). However, their efficacy remains controversial, and more than 70 randomized drug trials in ALS patients have shown little beneficial effect on patient survival (Roberts2022 pages 9-10).\n\nWhile the article by Agrawal2022 does not provide information on available or being researched therapeutics for ALS in 2022, the article by Belgin2022 discusses past and future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ALS, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, as well as emerging therapies such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy (Belgin2022 pages 1-1). The authors emphasize the multifaceted nature of ALS affected by many pathological mechanisms and the need for further research to develop effective treatments for ALS (Belgin2022 pages 1-1).\n\nThe article by Tereza2020 discusses various therapeutic approaches for ALS, including gene therapy, cell-based therapies, and neurotrophic factors (Tereza2020 pages 25-26).

Flying in a flock can result in aerodynamic benefits, reducing power requirements, as demonstrated by a reduction in heart rate and wingbeat frequency in pelicans flying in a V-formation (Usherwood2011). However, the aerodynamic consequences of flying in the more usual ‘cluster’ flock are not well understood (Usherwood2011). The main goal of the interaction among birds in a flock is to maintain cohesion of the aggregation, which is a strong biological requirement shaped by the evolutionary pressure for survival (Ballerini1232). Stragglers and small groups are significantly more prone to predation than animals belonging to large and highly cohesive aggregations (Ballerini1232). The vast majority of models, both developed by physicists and biologists, adopt a definition of ‘distance’ that is the same as in physics, i.e. metric distance, and animals can estimate metric distance in various ways, including stereovision, retinal image size, and optic flow (Ballerini1232). The variability of shape in bird flocks increases when there are larger local differences in movement behavior in the flock, which happens when flock size is larger, interacting partners are fewer, the flock turnings are stronger, and individuals roll into the turn (Hemelrijk2011). A major benefit of bird flocking behavior is that it increases collective vigilance and allows for early detection of attacking predators, which relies on rapid transfer of information about danger from the individual first detecting the predator (Mae4173). Acoustic signals or cues of danger are likely to be particularly effective, as information is passed rapidly to all nearby members of a group, and can be detected even if a bird is not currently vigilant or is out of sight (Mae4173). Flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many directions, which provides for faster information transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics, an advantage over local models (Pearce1042). It optimizes the information available to each bird while maintaining the protection of a dense, coherent flock (Pearce1042).",sources:[{key:"Usherwood2011 pages 1-1",text:"J.

While SELFIEs are more expressive and can represent a larger chemical space than SMILES (Akshat7079 pages 12-12), they are also more computationally expensive and require more memory (Akshat7079 pages 12-12). SELFIEs allow for efficient algorithms to perform exploration and interpolation in the chemical space without the need for extensive training times, large datasets, and hand-crafted rules for obtaining novel molecules (Akshat7079 pages 1-2). However, the text does not provide a direct comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of using SELFIEs and SMILES representations for deep learning in molecular modeling (Akshat7079 pages 4-4, 8-9).

Cutaneous gas exchange is enhanced by erythrocyte fragmentation in salamanders that possess large erythrocytes (Hsia2013 pages 35-36). The text does not provide specific information about whether salamanders use their skin, lungs, or other structures for breathing (Hsia2013 pages 34-35). However, in lung-breathing tetrapods, the respiratory apparatus consists of a gas-exchanger intimately connected to a passive pump, an active pump containing the respiratory musculature, and a central nervous control element that coordinates pump activity and optimizes the function of the gas exchanger. The gas exchanger communicates with the CNCE mainly via circulation, using blood pH and O2 saturation to regulate the frequency and amplitude of active ventilation. The structure of amniote gas-exchange tissue is superficially similar to that in lungfish or lissamphibians (Hsia2013 pages 35-36).",sources:[{key:"Hsia2013 pages 35-36",text:"C. Hsia, A. Schmitz, M.

The monolayer SWNTs can be patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the high currents (~3mA) SWNT devices with narrow channel widths. The method is generic for different bulk materials with various diameters (Xiaoling4890 pages 1-1). Another method for producing graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is by unzipping the side walls of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using intercalation with suitable ions. The intertube intercalation of CNTs by different ions has been shown to be an effective method to decrease the van der Waals interactions between individual tubes and assist the exfoliation of bundled CNTs. By selecting appropriate neutral molecules or ions to substitute H2SO4 as an intercalation agent, it shall be a promising approach to produce GNRs with a high yield and further reduce the usage of strong acid during the nanotube unzipping (Yan2016 pages 1-2). Additionally, a green and scalable method for the synthesis of graphene nanoribbons is by intercalation-assisted longitudinal unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with KNO3 and H2SO4, which decreases the strong van der Waals attractions in the MWCNTs bundles and between the coaxial graphene walls of CNTs. The developed methodology possesses the ability to synthesize GNRs effectively with an improved CNT concentration in H2SO4 of 10 mg/ml at 70 °C, which is amenable to industrial-scale production because of the decreased amount of strong acid (Yan2016 pages 1-1). The LB assembly of densely aligned SWNTs can be combined with chemical separation and selective chemical reaction methods to afford purely metallic or semiconducting SWNTs in massive parallel configuration useful for interconnection or high-speed transistor applications at large scale (Xiaoling4890 pages 2-2).",sources:[{key:"Xiaoling4890 pages 1-1",text:"Xiaoling Li, Li Zhang, Xinran Wang, I.

Riluzole and edaravone are the only two drugs approved by the FDA for ALS treatment, with riluzole being the most widely used, but their efficacy remains controversial (Roberts2022 pages 9-10).

Another approach is to use CAVER 3.0, which implements new algorithms for both the calculation and clustering of pathways. The algorithm consists of three separable steps: identification of pathways in each provided structure, clustering of pathways identified in all snapshots, and calculation and generation of output data. The implemented hierarchical average-link clustering algorithm ensures robust clustering results and enables an easy adjustment of the clustering parameters (Chovancov2012 pages 2-2).
